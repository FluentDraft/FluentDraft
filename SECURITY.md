## Reporting a Vulnerability

We prioritize the security and integrity of our software. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Procedure:**
Please use the **"Report a vulnerability"** button in the **Security** tab of our GitHub repository. This ensures the issue is submitted confidentially, keeping the public channel clean.

## Data Privacy & Integrity

We adhere to a strict philosophy of data privacy and "clean" operation:

*   **Local Execution**: FluentDraft is designed to be unobtrusive. Your voice data is processed locally or sent directly to your chosen provider (Groq/OpenAI) via secure, encrypted channels.
*   **API Key Safety**: Your API keys are your property. They are stored securely on your local machine and are **never** transmitted to us or any third parties.
*   **Clean Architecture**: The application creates no unnecessary footprint. We do not collect telemetry or personal data, respecting your digital environment.
